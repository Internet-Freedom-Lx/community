# üìú community
> We are a [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Internet-Freedom-Lisbon/) that focuses on Internet Freedom

The internet is no longer na√Øve. Governents and companies have realized its power and now want to control it as well as the people who use it -- [us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen). 

And something must be done about that!



## Information Board

* Still looking for a **space**. Contacted several libraries.
* If you are willing to do a **talk** on any related topic, message the organizer at francisco.core [at] protonmail.com
* In the future this community board is supposed to point people to important resources and maybe make an awesome list like [this one](https://github.com/drewrwilson/toolsforactivism).
